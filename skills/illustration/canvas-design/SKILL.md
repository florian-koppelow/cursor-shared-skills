# Canvas Design

Create design philosophies - aesthetic movements that are EXPRESSED VISUALLY. Output only .md files, .pdf files, and .png files.

Complete this in two steps:

1. Express by creating it on a canvas (.pdf file or .png file)
2. Design Philosophy Creation (.md file)

## Design Philosophy Creation

Create a VISUAL PHILOSOPHY (not layouts or templates) that will be interpreted through:

- Minimal text as visual accent
- Images, graphics, shapes, patterns
- Form, space, color, composition

### The Critical Understanding

- What happens next: The same version receives the philosophy and EXPRESSES IT VISUALLY - creating artifacts that are 90% visual design, 10% essential text.
- What is created: A design philosophy/aesthetic movement.
- What is received: Some subtle input or instructions by the user that should be taken into account, but used as a foundation; it should not constrain creative freedom.

The philosophy must emphasize: Visual expression. Spatial communication. Artistic interpretation. Minimal words.

### How to Generate a Visual Philosophy

**Name the movement (1-2 words):** "Brutalist Joy" / "Chromatic Silence" / "Metabolist Dreams"

**Articulate the philosophy (4-6 paragraphs - concise but complete):**

To capture the VISUAL essence, express how the philosophy manifests through:

- Visual hierarchy
- Composition and balance
- Scale and rhythm
- Color and material
- Space and form

**Critical Guidelines:**

- Leave creative space: Remain specific about the aesthetic direction, but concise enough that the next Claude has room to make interpretive choices also at an extremely high level of craftsmanship.
- Emphasize craftsmanship REPEATEDLY: The philosophy MUST stress multiple times that the final work should appear as though it took countless hours to create, was labored over with care, and comes from someone at the absolute top of their field.
- Avoid redundancy: Each design aspect should be mentioned once.

### Philosophy Examples

**"Concrete Poetry" Philosophy:** Communication through monumental form and bold geometry. Visual expression: Massive color blocks, sculptural typography (huge single words, tiny labels), Brutalist spatial divisions, Polish poster energy meets Le Corbusier.

**"Chromatic Language" Philosophy:** Color as the primary information system. Visual expression: Geometric precision where color zones create meaning. Typography minimal - small sans-serif labels letting chromatic fields communicate.

**"Analog Meditation" Philosophy:** Quiet visual contemplation through texture and breathing room. Visual expression: Paper grain, ink bleeds, vast negative space. Photography and illustration dominate.

**"Organic Systems" Philosophy:** Natural clustering and modular growth patterns. Visual expression: Rounded forms, organic arrangements, color from nature through architecture.

**"Geometric Silence" Philosophy:** Pure order and restraint. Visual expression: Grid-based precision, bold photography or stark graphics, dramatic negative space.

## Canvas Creation

With both the philosophy and the conceptual framework established, express it on a canvas.

**Important Guidelines:**

- For any type of content, even if the user requests something for a movie/game/book, the approach should still be sophisticated. Never lose sight of the idea that this should be art, not something that's cartoony or amateur.
- Create one single page, highly visual, design-forward PDF or PNG output (unless asked for more pages).
- Generally use repeating patterns and perfect shapes.
- Treat the abstract philosophical design as if it were a scientific bible.
- Add sparse, clinical typography and systematic reference markers.
- Embrace the paradox of using analytical visual language to express ideas about human experience.

**Text as a contextual element:** Text is always minimal and visual-first, but let context guide whether that means whisper-quiet labels or bold typographic gestures. Most of the time, font should be thin. All use of fonts must be design-forward and prioritize visual communication.

**Critical:** To achieve human-crafted quality (not AI-generated), create work that looks like it took countless hours. Make it appear as though someone at the absolute top of their field labored over every detail with painstaking care.

Output the final result as a single, downloadable .pdf or .png file, alongside the design philosophy used as a .md file.

## Final Step

The user ALREADY said "It isn't perfect enough. It must be pristine, a masterpiece of craftsmanship, as if it were about to be displayed in a museum."

To refine the work, avoid adding more graphics; instead refine what has been created and make it extremely crisp, respecting the design philosophy and the principles of minimalism entirely.

Take a second pass. Go back to the code and refine/polish further to make this a philosophically designed masterpiece.

## Multi-Page Option

To create additional pages when requested, create more creative pages along the same lines as the design philosophy but distinctly different as well. Bundle those pages in the same .pdf or many .pngs. Treat the first page as just a single page in a whole coffee table book waiting to be filled.
